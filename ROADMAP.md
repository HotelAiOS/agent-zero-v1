## 📝 Notes for Next Session

**Current Test Running:**
- `test_orchestration_mvp.py` - Testing Task Decomposer + Team Builder
- Expected: 9 tasks, 7 phases, 8 agents created

**Next Steps:**
1. Review test results
2. Commit current changes
3. Start Phase 1: Project Orchestrator implementation

**Context for Future AI:**
- LLM uses `chat()` method, not `complete()`
- AgentLifecycleManager has `self.agents` dict, not `get_agents_by_state()`
- Ollama supports streaming with `stream=True`
- Use sed for quick fixes (nano has issues with triple backticks)

**Current Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation) - COMPLETE ✅
**Next Phase:** Phase 1 (Execution Engine) - IN PLANNING
